1:
Experimenting needed: fluorescence z offset silently disables PFS
	Idea: optical focus starts thread that periodically monitors zstage and detects fast changes associated with focus loss.
	Idea: in separate thread monitor for loss of continuous focus lock, if found then go through refocus procedure
test software autofocus

2:
pending testing: fluorescence switches back to initial filter between every image.
add simple view for acquisition.

3:
Config: Tunable filter use dropdown for device name
disable wavelength field of fluorescence settings when using a standard camera.
Add autoexposure to sequencer

4:
Fluorescence "focus offset" is confusing to user
Add our own logger that format messages to the mm logger
Add a cell selection step (AI type stuff)
Focus lock snaps a single image and tests sharpness
